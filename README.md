# ExChat
The objective of this project was to gain experience in the Elixir language, in this case I used Phoenix (elixir web-framework) and Ecto. 

## INSTALATION

To run you need to have postgreSQL installed in you computer and run the following commands:

`mix ecto.create` -- Create Database

`mix phx.server` -- Start the server

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
